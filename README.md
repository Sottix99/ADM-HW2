# Second Homework for Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining
This repository refers to the [second homework](https://github.com/lucamaiano/ADM/tree/master/2022/Homework_2) of the ADM course at University Sapienza of Rome 2022/2023

## Abstract
Nowadays, social media is widely used, taking significant importance in people's lives and influencing how they live. Moreover, social media, which is here to stay, has substantially impacted how people communicate. Thus, available on iPhone and Android, Instagram is a free picture and video-sharing app. Their service allows users to post photographs and videos that they may then share with their followers or a small group of friends. In addition, they can also browse, comment on, and "like" the Instagram posts their friends have shared.

The goal is to answer some research questions (RQs) that may help to discover and interpret meaningful patterns in data and eventually understand how a user behaves on this social network.

There are two main files:

- `main.ipynb`:  a Jupyter notebook that contains all the answers to your research and theoretical questions.
- `CommandLine.sh`: a bash shell script file contains the prepared script to answer to the command line question.
